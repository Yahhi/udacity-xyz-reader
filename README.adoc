# XYZ Reader Starter Code

This repository stores the result code for the XYZ Reader project in Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

## Project Overview
In this project, I redesigned an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project?
This project gives me an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## Learning tasks
- Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
- Separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively use transitions and motion.

### User Feedback for XYZ Reader:
Lyla says:

> “This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

Jay says:

> “Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

Kagure says:

> “The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”

## What is the result
- App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
- App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
- App theme extends from AppCompat.
- App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
- App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
- App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
- App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
- App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
- App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
- App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
